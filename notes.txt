Abstract

The citation in the abstract?

Section 1.

In the introduction we need clearer explanations of the model we are presenting - and why we are using two (to show the same thing). 

Check I'be got the maths right. I'm a little uncertain of the probabilties as derived from the 1/kcat and (1 - 1/kcat). I need to run this by you.

Section 2.

Move the beginning statement "The initial modeling software used was Kinetiscope from Columbia Hill..." further down. We need the section to begin with a clear statement of what we are modelling. 

Captions for figure 1 and 2 - do these need amending?

Section 3.

After eqn 6, the statement:

"Based on the published rates of free radicals interaction with superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione, ascorbic acid, and protein it is evident that the rates are k_ea  k_nea  and k_ prot..."

is repeated after eqn 11:

"...the rate of neutralization of free radical species by enzymatic antioxidants is far greater than the rate of neutralization by non-enzymatic antioxidants, which in turn occurs at a much faster rate than damage to proteins by the free radical species, that is,  k ea  k nea  k prot..."

Can you give some thought on how to deal with this?

Is this sentence correct?

"Molecules with a size of the order of molecules such as glutathione and ascorbic acid..."

Conclusions

Can we change this:
"The models used are limited in the number of parameters..."

I know what you mean but the word "limited" has a negative conatation. Can put more positve spin on this statement?
